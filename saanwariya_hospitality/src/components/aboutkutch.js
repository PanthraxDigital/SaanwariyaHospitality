                moonlight, presents the stunning creation of nature. It is
                famous for the flat snow-white salt marsh, commonly called the
                White Desert, which is bone-dry all winter, then totally flooded

                heavy rainfall. On a full moon night, this already white washed
                desert lights up and transports you in another world where your
                heart meets your soul. So much of who we are is where we have
